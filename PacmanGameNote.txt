									--------PAC-MAN GAME---------
	--- we are using libGDX framework and entity component system to built this game
	---talking about ECS:
		--Component: the class has no method and only capable of storing data
			+ Ex: position(x, y), physic(body), health(value)...
		--Entity: is something that exist in game world, an entity is little more than a list of component. most impementations an entity is a unique ID, and all components that make up an entity will be tagged with that ID.
			+ Ex: Ball(pos, sprite, physic, state)
		--The System: Game logic is the job of the systems. A system operates on related groups of components. Each system will be updated once per frame in a logical order.
			+ Ex: MovementSystem(Pos, velocity)
